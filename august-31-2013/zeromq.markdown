## Build your next Python project - Super fast, distributed and infinitely scalable, using ZeroMQ
## Srinivasan R

#### Queues
* Require message brokers. Central point of failure
	* For e.g. Apache ActiveMQ, RabbitMQ, StormMQ, Redis

#### ZeroMQ
* No message broker. 
* Almost zero latency.
* Similar to AMQP

#### ZeroMQ: Basic Patterns
* Request/Reply
* Publish/Subscribe
* Pipelining
* Paired sockers

#### Request-Reply 
Image. TBD.

#### Hello World Server
Code. TBD.

#### Hello World Client
Code. TBD.

Next time, can you please increase the font size of slide content and Terminal? I could not take notes because of this.
