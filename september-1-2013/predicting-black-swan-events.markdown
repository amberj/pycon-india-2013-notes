## Predicting Black Swan Events
### Michael McKearns

#### Black swan events
* High impact, rare events
* Hard to predict
* Black swan events are everywhere. Examples: Hedge, credit and portfolio risk in stock market; combat scenarios; drug design; patient mortality etc. 

#### Why are black swans so hard to predict?
* Hardly anyone tries to solve real-world problems
* Convetion is to reduced problems and strong approximations.
* Most common: Use a prior to fix a probability distribution.
* Also common: assume a normal distribution and extrapolate.

#### Calculate risks with no approximations?
* Standard approximations:
	* Penalty functions
	* Use least expensive (approximate) surrogate
	* If data exists, use best-fit surrogate
	* Extract a probability distribution from data

#### Probability theory v/s uncertainity
* Subtle: Approximations make the problems 'solvable'.
* Problem reduced to a probability theory problem.

#### Optimal uncertainity quantification
Math 'stuff'! TBD.

#### OUQ version of bayesian inference
Math stuff, again! TBD.

#### Example: Shock in microstructure materials
* For weapons testing! How does a material react under effect of shockwave?
* Equations, math and diagrams!
