### Notes from PyCon India 2013.

Inspired by [pydanny](https://github.com/pydannyâ€Ž)'s [event notes repo on GitHub](https://github.com/pydanny/pydanny-event-notes), I decided to take live notes during [PyCon India 2013](in.pycon.org/2013/).

#### TODO:
Stuff I'll try todo, but I don't promise:

0. Proofread all notes once again to fix typos and add missing content.
1. Add links to presentation slides (if author has put them online).
2. Add links to corresponding videos when HasGeek puts them online.
3. Add links to talk's description page on PyConIndia website.
4. Add link to contact page/profile (of most, if not all, speakers).
